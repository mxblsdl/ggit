# Simple git cli

A tool to explore retrieving statuses with git. Inspired by exploring more cli arguments to `git`

While other tools may exist that do a similar thing, I wanted to go through the steps of creating this myself 
both to practice with the Typer package and to think through what is the best workflow I could have with `git`.
